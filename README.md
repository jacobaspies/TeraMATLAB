# TeraMATLAB
The following is a collection of scripts for performing THz measurements using script-based acquisition in MATLAB. In-line data processing utilizes function that are distributed in THz data processing package "Nelly" (https://github.com/YaleTHz/nelly)^1 and should be installed in the path of data acquisition codes.

# Currently Supported Hardware
- Stanford Research Systems SR810/SR830 Lock-in amplifier
  - Communication using one of the following USB-GPIB adapters:
    - Agilent/Keysight 82357B
    - National Instruments GPIHB-USB-HS
- Thorlabs BBD30X controller for DDS direct-drive delay stages
